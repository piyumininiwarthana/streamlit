# Sales ML Streamlit App

### Project overview
This project trains regression models to predict **Revenue** (Price × Quantity) from a transactional sales dataset and provides a Streamlit web app for EDA, model comparison, and interactive predictions. The app demonstrates a full ML pipeline: EDA → preprocessing → model training → deployment.

### Files
- `app.py` — Streamlit application (open in canvas; save to project root)
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies
- `data/dataset.csv` — Place your CSV here (rename the file to `dataset.csv`)
- `model.pkl` — Saved models (created after training)
- `notebooks/model_training.py` — script for training & saving the model (can be converted to a notebook)
- `README.md` — this file
